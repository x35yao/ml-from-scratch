# ML from Scratch 🧑‍💻

A collection of classic machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python.  
The goal is educational: understand how algorithms work under the hood by building them step by step.

## 📂 Project Structure
src/mlscratch/ # Core implementations of algorithms
examples/ # Jupyter notebooks with usage demos
datasets/ # Small datasets (CSV or loaders)
tests/ # Unit tests
benchmarks/ # Simple speed/accuracy comparisons vs scikit-learn
docs/ # Documentation


## ✅ Implemented Algorithms
- Linear
  -   Notes: Standardizing data (X, y) makes a big difference for the gradient-based method.
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Decision Trees, Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- SVM (linear + kernel)
- PCA, LDA
- KMeans, GMM
- Neural Networks (simple MLP)

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/x35yao/ml-from-scratch.git
cd ml-from-scratch
pip install -e .[dev]
